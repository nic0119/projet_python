4,Why do people hate on women's basketball and not take it serious? If you see them in person they're very talented.,spankyourkopita,"Maybe it's not like the men's game  but I've gone to some high school, D!, and WNBA games and these girls are no slouches. Maybe its more of a joke in high school but there's some freak athletes in D1 and I seriously don't know if I'd be able to hang with some of these girls if I scrimmaged with them. At the very least I'd have to respect them and wouldn't be able to just walk over them. Some of these girls could probably cross me over, block my shots, steal,  and box me out on a rebound. I'm 5'11'' and I'd be average height playing with D1 or WNBA players. So when I see people laugh at women's basketball I just don't get it. If you watch the men's game more then that's understandable because its a different style of play but if you're just hating to hate and think they suck you have no clue about basketball.",2025/01/10,Reddit,,0

15,When should I start playing basketball again after a sprained ankle?,Unable_Scheme4191,"Got undercut on a jump shot exactly 2 months ago and severely sprained my ankle. Went to urgent care, they gave me a splint and crutches and took an x ray which showed no fracture, told me to come back in a week if I still couldn’t put weight on it and charged me 75 bucks for a copay.

However I still cannot run without pain. I really don’t want to spend another 75 dollars but at this point it’s been a while and I really want this to be healed so I can get back to playing.

20,My son is good but timid in games,Longjumping_Ad_2815,"My son (15) is really good in pick up games and low pressure environments.  But when he plays for his freshmen team in high school, he looks like a completely different player.  I'm guessing its nerves.  He plays very timid and doesn't insert himself like he does in pickup games.  Doesn't help that his coach is a first year coach and probably cannot help.  He has a crazy work ethic and probably could add some weight.  He is a short (5'5) shooting guard.His timid play has resulted in losing his starting spot and limited to fewer minutes on the court while players that aren't as good as he is get more time.  Coach wants him to be a 3&D player which are his strong suits.Any tips or advice I could give him?  I always tell him to pretend he is playing against me in the backyard (where he plays the hardest) in the games but it doesn't seem to help.edit: I will also add that sometimes when he gets a good offensive or defensive play, he loosens up a little and plays better. This worked better when he was getting more time but with limited time, he never ""gets going"".  I need him to be right in the head from the beginning.  He pressures himself to be better, the pressure does not come from me.edit #2: He prefers street ball and is good at it (low pressure).  He is also an outstanding defensive player (won defensive player of the year award in 8th grade) as the shortest player.  He is great at guarding and stealing passes.",2025/01/07,Reddit,,0

I know the game is much different from when I played - that they are looking for different kinds of shots, but shouldn't these bigs at least be PIVOTING AND FACING the basket at least half of the time? Or better yet, performing one of the tried and true and basically unstoppable post moves for a high-percentage shot? It's not just high school either. NBA post players are woefully inept at the quick drop step or just basic pivoting/reverse-pivoting, which BTW, you can see the court just as well doing.

22,Do you think there's a way to get Steph Curry help in Golden State or does he seriously need to think about leaving? Is he better suited to join another team?,spankyourkopita,Reoccurring theme with the Warriors is Steph doesn't have enough help and has to carry the team. Its just mindboggling how you have the best shooter in the world and can't get him quality shooters around him.  I don't know if you just get the right players around him or if there's nothing the Warriors can do. It feels like the ship has sailed in Golden State and Steph would be better suited as a #2 on a contender.  I feel he's almost in a similar situation as Klay where he has to choose his next move. He's got some heavy thinking to do because as much as he wants to retire as a Warrior I'm certain he doesn't want to go out like this and just put up stats on a weak team.,2025/01/08,Reddit,,0

25,Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies,David Prendergast,"The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configurationinteraction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with thepseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effectiveelectron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces thescattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zeroelectron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for thissmooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, bothwith the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effectiveelectron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion ofthe wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is notsignificantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interactionfor energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary topopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limitingfactor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.",2001/02/28,Arxiv,,
26,Electron thermal conductivity owing to collisions between degenerate  electrons,P. S. Shternin,We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced byelectron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gastaking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landaudamping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativisticelectrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the innercrust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivitycompletely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion(electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electronconductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.,2006/08/17,Arxiv,,
27,Electron pairing: from metastable electron pair to bipolaron,Guo-Qiang Hai,"Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlationwithin electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects betweentwo electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the averagecorrelation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of thecrystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of thevalence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energyband above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, wecalculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and thepolaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electronpairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential tocounterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. Theinterplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifestedin the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, isresponsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are locatedon the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.",2018/02/19,Arxiv,,
28,Electron Temperature Anisotropy and Electron Beam Constraints From  Electron Kinetic Instabilities in the Solar Wind,Heyu Sun,"Electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams are nonthermal featuresof the observed nonequilibrium electron velocity distributions in the solarwind. In collision-poor plasmas these nonequilibrium distributions are expectedto be regulated by kinetic instabilities through wave-particle interactions.This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of coreelectron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives acomprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to thebackground magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,parallel core electron plasma beta $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, coreelectron temperature anisotropy $A_{\mathrm{ec}}\equivT_{\mathrm{ec\perp}}/T_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity$V_{\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electronbeam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electronbeam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotroninstability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehoseinstability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electronbeam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in thelow-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-and large-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime. It also finds that a newoblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron beamwith $V_{\mathrm{eb}}\gtrsim7V_{\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}\sim0.1-2$ and $A_{\mathrm{ec}}<1$. Moreover, thisstudy presents electromagnetic responses of each kind of electron instability.These results provide a comprehensive overview for electron instabilityconstraints on core electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams in thesolar wind.",2020/10/02,Arxiv,,
29,Hamiltonian of a many-electron system with single-electron and  electron-pair states in a two-dimensional periodic potential,G. -Q. Hai,"Based on the metastable electron-pair energy band in a two-dimensional (2D)periodic potential obtained previously by Hai and Castelano [J. Phys.: Condens.Matter 26, 115502 (2014)], we present in this work a Hamiltonian of manyelectrons consisting of single electrons and electron pairs in the 2D system.The electron-pair states are metastable of energies higher than those of thesingle-electron states at low electron density. We assume two differentscenarios for the single-electron band. When it is considered as the lowestconduction band of a crystal, we compare the obtained Hamiltonian with thephenomenological model Hamiltonian of a boson-fermion mixture proposed byFriedberg and Lee [Phys. Rev. B 40, 6745 (1989)]. Single-electron-electron-pairand electron-pair-electron-pair interaction terms appear in our Hamiltonian andthe interaction potentials can be determined from the electron-electron Coulombinteractions. When we consider the single-electron band as the highest valenceband of a crystal, we show that holes in this valence band are important forstabilization of the electron-pair states in the system.",2015/01/20,Arxiv,,
30,Electron-Electron Bremsstrahlung Emission and the Inference of Electron  Flux Spectra in Solar Flares,Eduard P. Kontar,"Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute tothe hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Suchan omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung ingeneral makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-rayspectrum steeper at high energies.  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannotproduce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. Themaximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction ofthe emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnosticfor an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the acceleratedelectrons.  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and showthat the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum isnaturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularizedinversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes bothelectron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectralindex $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electronspectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energyexists.",2007/07/28,Arxiv,,

33,Insights into the Electron-Electron Interaction from Quantum Monte Carlo  Calculations,Carl A. Kukkonen,"The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends onboth the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic QuantumMonte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and usedto quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electroninteraction. Together with the charge local field factor from previousDiffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of theeffective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensionalelectron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local fieldfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of theelectron gas at metallic densities.  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. Atthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electroninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to largecancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller thaneither term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to theelectron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The staticelectron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is lessrepulsive for electrons with parallel spins.  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive backgroundis shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As asimple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated usingthe measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.The net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for theother alkali metals.",2021/01/26,Arxiv,,

Karakurt,"We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions usingmagnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons onliquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are twoorders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both theindependent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by theself-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interactingelectron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drudetheory as a function of electron density.",2002/04/30,Arxiv,,
35,Interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interaction in ZnO-based  electron system,D. Maryenko,"Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is pivotal for various fundamental spin-dependentphenomena in solids and their technological applications. In semiconductors,these phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electroninteraction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC canprofoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to theemergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on theelectric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,electron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstratethe emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron systemin a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron systemfeatures also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing thecarrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve itsinterplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way toemergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to theformation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled tothe density.",2020/10/06,Arxiv,,
36,Free-electron properties of metals under ultrafast laser-induced  electron-phonon nonequilibrium: A first-principles study,Emile Bévillon,"The electronic behavior of various solid metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Au, Ti, and W)under ultrashort laser irradiation is investigated by means of densityfunctional theory. Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecondtime scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical couplingand transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on thefree-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.However, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on theelectronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principlescalculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronictemperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on theconcept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependentfree-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a largerange of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronictemperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures oftransition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation inlocalized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ioneffective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibriumdensity of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,free-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.Thus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving asa base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description ofexcitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action.",2014/03/20,Arxiv,,
37,First-principles calculations of hot-electron lifetimes in metals,I. Campillo,"First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energyelectrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates areevaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we computewithin the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are thenobtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with fullinclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are alsoreported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of theband structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smallerthan those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found inBe, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in thedensity of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactionsyields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in afree-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$)electrons.",2000/02/21,Arxiv,,
38,First-principles calculations of heat capacities of ultrafast  laser-excited electrons in metals,Emile Bévillon,"Ultrafast laser excitation can induce fast increases of the electronicsubsystem temperature. The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of bandstructure and energy distribution can determine the change of severalthermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; theelectronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed atfinite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent onelectronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including freeelectron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange andcorrelation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronicheat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases.Then, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying thenumber of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can becorrectly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence oflocalized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of theelectronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermallyexcite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collectiveexcitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at hightemperature.",2015/03/24,Arxiv,,
39,"Born-Oppenheimer Dynamics, Electronic Friction, and the Inclusion of  Electron-Electron Interactions",Wenjie Dou,"We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by aset of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold ofquantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of theelectronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Ourderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for thecoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximationwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclearmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduceto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.Hamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the secondfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix issymmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, westudy electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a propertreatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondoresonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate.",2017/03/14,Arxiv,,
40,D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation for degenerate electrons in the  electron-hole liquid,Matthew D. Mower,"We present an analytical study of the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation timefor degenerate electrons in a photo-excited electron-hole liquid in intrinsicsemiconductors exhibiting a spin-split band structure. The D'yakonov-Perel'spin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-holescattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering andvirtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effectiveelectron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spinrelaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to becomparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - acommon model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-holepairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of thescattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation ispredicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.In the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' modelfails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by freeprecession of individual quasiparticle spins.",2010/10/27,Arxiv,,
41,Emergence and spectral-weight transfer of electronic states in the  Hubbard ladder,Masanori Kohno,"The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless ofthe electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, thespectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electrondensity, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electrondensity changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and becomedominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbardladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using thenon-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A modeemerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as theelectron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics atquarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in thelow-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Motttransition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersionrelation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of theelectronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a newperspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronicstates over a wide energy and electron-density regime.",2019/12/11,Arxiv,,
42,Electronic Properties Of Buckminsterfullerenes: Degeneracies and  Surprises,Assa Auerbach,"Buckminsterfullerene compounds exibit remarkable physics at low temperatures,e.g. high temperature superconductivity in alkali-fullerenes, andferromagnetism in TDAE -C60. Here we review recent theoretical studies ofelectron correlations in these compounds. In particular, we discuss models ofelectron-vibron interactions, electron-electron interactions, andintermolecular hopping. We show that the origin of novel electronic phases liesin {\em local} degeneracies of C60; a direct consequence of the high molecularsymmetry.",1996/10/08,Arxiv,,
43,Energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron liquid,N. M. Chtchelkatchev,"The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems isstudied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation inwhich the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends onthe electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rateis found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of theelectron system.",2007/08/03,Arxiv,,
44,Shear viscosity of degenerate electron matter,P. S. Shternin,We calculate the partial electron shear viscosity $\eta_{ee}$ limited byelectron-electron collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking intoaccount the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping stronglysuppresses $\eta_{ee}$ in the domain of ultrarelativistic degenerate electronsand modifies its %asymptotic temperature behavior. The efficiency of theelectron shear viscosity in the cores of white dwarfs and envelopes of neutronstars is analyzed.,2008/03/27,Arxiv,,
45,Plasmon-assisted electron-electron collisions at metallic surfaces,Konstantin A. Kouzakov,"We present a theoretical treatment for the ejection of a secondary electronfrom a clean metallic surface induced by the impact of a fast primary electron.Assuming a direct scattering between the incident, primary electron and theelectron in a metal, we calculate the electron-pair energy distributions at thesurfaces of Al and Be. Different models for the screening of theelectron-electron interaction are examined and the footprints of the surfaceand the bulk plasmon modes are determined and analyzed. The formulatedtheoretical approach is compared with the available experimental data on theelectron-pair emission from Al.",2012/02/19,Arxiv,,
46,The electric field of an electron in a electron-hole plasma with  degenerate electrons,S. P. Sadykova,We consider the possibility of formation of a superconductivity state eitherin a semiconductor or in a electron-hole plasma with the degenerate electronsdue to the attractive forces between the electrons as a result of the exchangeeffects through the electron-hole sound wave by analogy to the phonon waves ina solid state. We have determined the view of an interaction potential betweentwo electrons in a degenerate electron-hole plasma. The potential appears to beattractive at distances large than the Debye radius and decreases as $1/r^3$.We discuss the conditions at which the bound electron state - Cooper Pair in asuch field can be formed.,2018/06/28,Arxiv,,
47,Resonant electron-phonon-electron interaction,Jiang-Tao Liu,"The effect of the resonance of electron scattering energy difference andphonon energy on the electron-phonon-electron interaction (EPEI) is studied.Results show that the resonance of electron transition energy and phonon energycan enhance EPEI by a magnitude of 1 to 2. Moreover, the anisotropic S-waveelectron or dx2-y2 electron can enhance resonance EPEI, and the self-energycorrection of the electron will weaken resonance EPEI. Particularly, theasymmetrical spin-flip scattering process in k space can reduce the effect ofelectronic self-energy to enhance resonance EPEI",2016/07/08,Arxiv,,
48,Lattice deformation induced by hot carriers in graphene,E. G. Mishchenko,"Hot electrons formed in a graphene crystal by high-intensity short-durationlaser pulses can exist for a time that is less than an electron-phonon energyrelaxation time. During that time, electron-electron collisions cause theelectrons to thermalize to a local effective temperature that propagates(diffuses) through graphene. The non-uniform nature of the electron temperatureleads to a force acting on the graphene lattice. This force is the result ofthe electron-lattice interaction that exists even at times that are less thanthe electron-phonon scattering time. The force causes the lattice to deform. ABoltzmann equation description of the transient electron-lattice deformationcauses by hot electrons in graphene is presented.",2024/02/20,Arxiv,,

We introduce sub-Landau levels ofthe two-electron states by determining their energies and degeneracies. Theeffects of electron correlation, Zeeman splitting and energy-level broadeningon the stability of the electron-pair states are discussed.
