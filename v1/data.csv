5	Maybe it's not like the men's game  but I've gone to some high school, D!, and WNBA games and these girls are no slouches. Maybe its more of a joke in high school but there's some freak athletes in D1 and I seriously don't know if I'd be able to hang with some of these girls if I scrimmaged with them.   At the very least I'd have to respect them and wouldn't be able to just walk over them. Some of these girls could probably cross me over, block my shots, steal,  and box me out on a rebound. I'm 5'11'' and I'd be average height playing with D1 or WNBA players.   So when I see people laugh at women's basketball I just don't get it.

This probably sounds like im greedy but nah Im actually pretty good at basketball I’m probably better than most at my school/grade and I’m not at all cocky about it either. I always play good in 1v1s, scrimmages, practices and all that, but whenever I play an actual game, pick up or in an serious league, my teammates almost never pass me the ball even if I call for it/coach says to give it to me. It’s not like I play bad either I always play my best, never force shots or anything and I don’t consider my communication too bad.

Went to urgent care, they gave me a splint and crutches and took an x ray which showed no fracture, told me to come back in a week if I still couldn’t put weight on it and charged me 75 bucks for a copay. A week later I was able to walk fine but ankle still was iffy, began doing some rehab exercises I found on the Internet.  As of right now I am able to walk/incline walk on a treadmill, jump rope, squat heavy, and do single leg bodyweight movements (haven’t tried with weight yet). However I still cannot run without pain.

21	"My son (15) is really good in pick up games and low pressure environments.  But when he plays for his freshmen team in high school, he looks like a completely different player.  I'm guessing its nerves.  He plays very timid and doesn't insert himself like he does in pickup games.  Doesn't help that his coach is a first year coach and probably cannot help.  He has a crazy work ethic and probably could add some weight.  He is a short (5'5) shooting guard.  His timid play has resulted in losing his starting spot and limited to fewer minutes on the court while players that aren't as good as he is get more time.  Coach wants him to be a 3&D player which are his strong suits.  Any tips or advice I could give him?  I always tell him to pretend he is playing against me in the backyard (where he plays the hardest) in the games but it doesn't seem to help.  edit: I will also add that sometimes when he gets a good offensive or defensive play, he loosens up a little and plays better. This worked better when he was getting more time but with limited time, he never ""gets going"".  I need him to be right in the head from the beginning.  He pressures himself to be better, the pressure does not come from me.  edit #2: He prefers street ball and is good at it (low pressure).  He is also an outstanding defensive player (won defensive player of the year award in 8th grade) as the shortest player.  He is great at guarding and stealing passes."	Reddit
22	I watch my old high school play all its games on NFHS and it drives me insane to watch their post men receive the ball on the block time after time and not even PRETEND to have any intention of making any kind of ATTEMPT to score down there before looking to kick it back out to someone. I know the game is much different from when I played - that they are looking for different kinds of shots, but shouldn't these bigs at least be PIVOTING AND FACING the basket at least half of the time? Or better yet, performing one of the tried and true and basically unstoppable post moves for a high-percentage shot? It's not just high school either. NBA post players are woefully inept at the quick drop step or just basic pivoting/reverse-pivoting, which BTW, you can see the court just as well doing. So, my question is, are post moves just not taught or stressed at the high school level anymore and if they are, why aren't players using them in games for quick easy scores?	Reddit

26	"The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration
interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the
pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective
electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the
scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero
electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this
smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.
We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both
with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective
electron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of
the wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not
significantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction
for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to
popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting
factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations."	Arxiv
27	"We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by
electron-electron Coulomb scattering in a strongly degenerate electron gas
taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau
damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic
electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner
crust of a neutron star at temperatures T < 1e7 K this thermal conductivity
completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion
(electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron
conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions."	Arxiv
28	"Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation
within electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between
two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average
correlation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the
crystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the
valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy
band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.
In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we
calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the
polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron
pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to
counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The
interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested
in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is
responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located
on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band."	Arxiv
29	"Electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams are nonthermal features
of the observed nonequilibrium electron velocity distributions in the solar
wind. In collision-poor plasmas these nonequilibrium distributions are expected
to be regulated by kinetic instabilities through wave-particle interactions.
This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of core
electron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives a
comprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the
background magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,
parallel core electron plasma beta $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, core
electron temperature anisotropy $A_{\mathrm{ec}}\equiv
T_{\mathrm{ec\perp}}/T_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity
$V_{\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electron
beam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron
beam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron
instability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose
instability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electron
beam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the
low-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-
and large-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime. It also finds that a new
oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron beam
with $V_{\mathrm{eb}}\gtrsim7V_{\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where
$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}\sim0.1-2$ and $A_{\mathrm{ec}}<1$. Moreover, this
study presents electromagnetic responses of each kind of electron instability.
These results provide a comprehensive overview for electron instability
constraints on core electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams in the
solar wind."	Arxiv
30	"Based on the metastable electron-pair energy band in a two-dimensional (2D)
periodic potential obtained previously by Hai and Castelano [J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter 26, 115502 (2014)], we present in this work a Hamiltonian of many
electrons consisting of single electrons and electron pairs in the 2D system.
The electron-pair states are metastable of energies higher than those of the
single-electron states at low electron density. We assume two different
scenarios for the single-electron band. When it is considered as the lowest
conduction band of a crystal, we compare the obtained Hamiltonian with the
phenomenological model Hamiltonian of a boson-fermion mixture proposed by
Friedberg and Lee [Phys. Rev. B 40, 6745 (1989)]. Single-electron-electron-pair
and electron-pair-electron-pair interaction terms appear in our Hamiltonian and
the interaction potentials can be determined from the electron-electron Coulomb
interactions. When we consider the single-electron band as the highest valence
band of a crystal, we show that holes in this valence band are important for
stabilization of the electron-pair states in the system."	Arxiv
31	"Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to
the hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such
an omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\sim 300$
keV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in
general makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray
spectrum steeper at high energies.
  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot
produce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The
maximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of
the emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic
for an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated
electrons.
  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show
that the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is
naturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.
Indeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized
inversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both
electron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral
index $\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E
= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron
spectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy
exists."	Arxiv

particle and antiparticle. There exists neutral proton-electron symmetry.
Proton-electron equilibrium is defined by the proton-electron mass difference.
At the temperature equal to the mass of electron, pairs of neutral electrons

protons and electrons."	Arxiv
33	"We present a class of exactly solvable models of correlated electrons. The
models are defined in any dimension $d$ and consist of electron-hopping terms
and local attractive interactions between electrons. For each even number of
electrons less than or equal to $1/(d+1)$-filling, we find the exact ground
state in which all electrons form pairs of a certain type, and thus the models
exhibit an electron-pair condensation."	Arxiv
34	"The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on
both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum
Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used
to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron
interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous
Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the
effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional
electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field
factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the
electron gas at metallic densities.
  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At
the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)
term and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron
interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large
cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than
either term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the
electron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static
electron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less
repulsive for electrons with parallel spins.
  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background
is shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a
simple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using
the measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.
The net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors
$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the
other alkali metals."	Arxiv
35	"We probe the strength of electron-electron interactions using
magnetoconductivity measurements of two-dimensional non-degenerate electrons on
liquid helium at 1.22 K. Our data extend to electron densities that are two
orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We span both the
independent-electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), and the strongly-interacting
electron regime. At finite fields we observe a crossover from SCBA to Drude
theory as a function of electron density."	Arxiv
36	"Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is pivotal for various fundamental spin-dependent
phenomena in solids and their technological applications. In semiconductors,
these phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron
interaction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can
profoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the
emergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the
electric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,
electron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate
the emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system
in a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system
features also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the
carrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its
interplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way to
emergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to the
formation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled to
the density."	Arxiv
37	"The electronic behavior of various solid metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Au, Ti, and W)
under ultrashort laser irradiation is investigated by means of density
functional theory. Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecond
time scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical coupling
and transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the
free-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.
However, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the
electronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles
calculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic
temperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the
concept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent
free-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large
range of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic
temperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of
transition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in
localized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion
effective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium
density of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,
free-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.
Thus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as
a base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of
excitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action."	Arxiv
38	"First-principles calculations of the inelastic lifetime of low-energy
electrons in Al, Mg, Be, and Cu are reported. Quasiparticle damping rates are
evaluated from the knowledge of the electron self-energy, which we compute
within the GW approximation of many-body theory. Inelastic lifetimes are then
obtained along various directions of the electron wave vector, with full
inclusion of the band structure of the solid. Average lifetimes are also
reported, as a function of the electron energy. In Al and Mg, splitting of the
band structure over the Fermi level yields electron lifetimes that are smaller
than those of electrons in a free-electron gas. Larger lifetimes are found in
Be, as a result of the characteristic dip that this material presents in the
density of states near the Fermi level. In Cu, a major contribution from $d$
electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions
yields electron lifetimes which are well above those of electrons in a
free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of valence ($4s^1$)
electrons."	Arxiv
39	"Ultrafast laser excitation can induce fast increases of the electronic
subsystem temperature. The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of band
structure and energy distribution can determine the change of several
thermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the
electronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at
finite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent on
electronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including free
electron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and
correlation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic
heat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases.
Then, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the
number of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be
correctly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of
localized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the
electronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally
excite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective
excitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high
temperature."	Arxiv
40	"We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a
set of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of
quantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the
electronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our
derivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the
coupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation
whereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear
movement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce
to previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.
Hamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second
fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is
symmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we
study electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper
treatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo
resonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate."	Arxiv
41	"We present an analytical study of the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation time
for degenerate electrons in a photo-excited electron-hole liquid in intrinsic
semiconductors exhibiting a spin-split band structure. The D'yakonov-Perel'
spin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole
scattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and
virtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions
(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective
electron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin
relaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to be
comparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a
common model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole
pairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the
scattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is
predicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.
In the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model
fails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free
precession of individual quasiparticle spins."	Arxiv
42	"The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of
the electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the
spectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron
density, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron
density changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become
dominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard
ladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the
non-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode
emerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the
electron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at
quarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the
low-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott
transition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion
relation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the
electronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new
perspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic
states over a wide energy and electron-density regime."	Arxiv

the electron-lattice interaction that exists even at times that are less than
the electron-phonon scattering time. The force causes the lattice to deform. A

in strong magnetic field, we investigate the quantum states of two interacting
electrons in the quantum Hall effect regime. We introduce sub-Landau levels of
the two-electron states by determining their energies and degeneracies. The
effects of electron correlation, Zeeman splitting and energy-level broadening
on the stability of the electron-pair states are discussed. It is shown that
the two electrons in the triplet state with spins aligned parallel to the
magnetic field can form a stable electron pair in the 2D system in GaAs/AlGaAs
heterojunction. A wavefunction of many electron pairs are presented and
compared with the Laughlin wavefunction."	Arxiv
